# Week 1

Welcome to the course! We are happy that you decided to pick this course up. We hope that it will be an enriching experience for all of us. Week 1 will deal with getting started
with coding. This will include setting up your system, learning the basics of Python and its related libraries. 

## Week 1 Objectives

- Code any given algorithm/problem statement using Python.
- Learn some vital data libraries in Python. 
- Able to quickly search for a functionality on the web. For example, a statistical function needed in an analytical project.
- Data intuition. Play around with data, use your creativity and analytical skills to find information out of structured Data Sets intuitively.

## Week 1 Resources

- **Introduction to Python Programming Language.**

We believe it's better to learn coding by doing. If you're a complete newbie, you may solve the first few questions available at [HackerRank Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python).
You'd have to make an account if you don't have one. 
**Solve the first 12 problems (till "Tuples")**. 

*Note: You may skip this if you're already comfortable with the very basics of Python.*

- **Setup and install Anaconda for Python**

The process can be quickly learned on the web, in case of any doubt, you may ask us in the communication groups. 

- Get accustomed to Jupyter Notebooks. 

- **Learn Python Libraries**
