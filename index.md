## Quantitative Finance by Cutting Edge Visionaries, NIT Surat

---

This course is an initiative by CEV in order to equip talented and enthusisatic engineers for the world of Quantitative Finance. Post 2008 crisis data world has made this field very famous and lucrative. Although Indian Universities haven't yet offered this as majors, except a few, mostly IITs and ISI, almost every major T as well as B schools in the west have been teaching them since before the '08 crisis. The courses go by varied names - Quantitative Finance, Mathematical Finance, Financial Engineering, etc all mostly pertaining to the same fields with almost similar curricula (with subtle differences ofcourse)

## What is Quantitative Finance?

---

Quant Finance is the field wherein emphasis is given on the use of math models, probability, statistics, quantitative models in order to predict future prices of various Financial instruments like equities and derivatives. The filed differs from traditional finance in way that, we do not pay much attention to the financials or other regular finance 101 predictors and solely rely on these "Quant Models" in order to make buying selling decisions. In a way it is mostly an application of Pure Mathematics rather than Finance.

## Why should you pursue this course?

---

Mostly, the candidates are either engineering undergrads or pure science majors  (math, physics) which are purely quantitative fields. It is highly likely that us engineers already have fallen in love with math and algorithms, and hence it becomes very interesting to pursue such a course which is a direct application of math and coding. Apart from this, there is a steep rise in the number of engineers interested in Data Science, and Quant Finance is similar - In a way Data Science applied to Finance! We are sure if Mathematics, Technology, Algorithms, Models are your thing you will find this course very interesting. Again, you don't at all have to be experts, just passionate, we'll handle the rest!

## A brief idea

---

This course is designed in such a way that we will explore the required math and coding skills in parallel. The math models, methods which you'll learn in a week will be applied in a programmatic way using Python. The course flow can be viewed here.

We will cover :

* Python and its required libraries
* Basics of Global Financial Markets and Instruments
* Linear Algebra
* Probability Theory
* Stochastic Processes
* Technical Indicators 
* Algorithmic Strategies
* Volatility, VAR Models and Pricing, etc.

More information will be shared as the course proceeds. 
Mathematical part of the course will directly follow the MIT OCW course which goes by the name [Topics in Mathematics with Applications in Finance](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s096-topics-in-mathematics-with-applications-in-finance-fall-2013/)
