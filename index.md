## QF101 by CEV Aryavarta

---

This course is an initiative by CEV to equip talented and enthusiastic engineers for the world of Quantitative Finance. Post 2008 crisis data world has made this field very famous and lucrative. Although Indian Universities haven’t yet offered QF majors, except a few, mostly IITs and ISI, almost every top T and B schools in the West have been teaching them since before the ‘08 crisis. The courses go by varied names - Quantitative Finance, Mathematical Finance, Financial Engineering, etc. all mostly pertaining to the same fields with almost similar curricula (with subtle differences, of course)

---

## What is Quantitative Finance?

---

Quant Finance is the field wherein emphasis is given on math models, probability, statistics, and quantitative models to predict future prices of various Financial instruments like equities and derivatives. The field differs from traditional Finance in a way that we do not pay much attention to the financials or other regular finance 101 predictors and solely rely on these "Quant Models" to make buying/selling decisions. In a way, it is mostly an application of Pure Mathematics rather than Finance.

## Why should you pursue this course?

---

The candidates are mostly engineering undergrads or pure science majors  (math, physics), which are purely quantitative fields. It is highly likely that engineers have already fallen in love with math and algorithms. Hence, it becomes fascinating to pursue such a course, which is a direct application of math and coding. Apart from this, there is a steep rise in the number of engineers interested in Data Science, and Quant Finance is similar - In a way, Data Science applied to Finance! We are sure if Mathematics, Technology, Algorithms, Models are your thing, you will find the course exciting. Again, you don't have to be experts, just passionate. We'll handle the rest!

---

## A brief idea

---

This course is designed in such a way that we will explore the required math and coding skills in parallel. The math models, methods which you'll learn in a week will be applied in a programmatic way using Python. The course flow can be viewed [here](https://high-in-entropy.github.io/quant-finance/modules/structure/index/).

We will cover :

* Python and its required libraries
* Basics of Global Financial Markets and Instruments
* Linear Algebra
* Probability Theory
* Stochastic Processes
* Technical Indicators 
* Algorithmic Strategies
* Volatility, VAR Models and Pricing, etc.

More information will be shared as the course proceeds. 
Mathematical part of the course will directly follow the MIT OCW course which goes by the name [Topics in Mathematics with Applications in Finance](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s096-topics-in-mathematics-with-applications-in-finance-fall-2013/)
